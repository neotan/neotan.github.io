Hi there! I'm Neo Tan, an [InfoQ.com/cn](http://www.infoq.com/cn/profile/%E8%B0%88%E6%B5%A9) editor and web developer at EPAM. Previously a software engineer at Alibaba and IBM. I'm focusing on front-end technology.

I'm a big fans of [Fallout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)) and [Call of Duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty) when I'm not coding =).
